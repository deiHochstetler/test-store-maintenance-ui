Test Store Maintenance

Overview
This repo contains an application that performs QA test store data maintenance. It allows you to:
  a) search for the existence of an given test store number,
  b) create a new test store by cloning a specific production store and masking identifying data, or
  c) delete an existing test store number.

To create a test store the app first finds the production store number to be cloned inside the SOURCE database.  It then masks the identifying fields, creates a new BU_ID for the test store, and inserts the new test store rows into the DESTINATION database.

The tables that are created for test stores are:
  - EPR_BU
  - EPR_STR
  - BU_OPS_HIER (pending)
  - BU_MER_HIER (pending)
  - FPRD_BU_OPS_HIER (pending)
  - FPRD_BU_MER_HIER (pending)
  - EPR_PRTY_SRC_X (pending)
  - OS_BU (pending)
  - PRTY_CMECH_ROLE (pending)


To run the application locally:
  yarn run dev
